# 🎬 Movie Recommendation System  
### Foundations of Big Data Analytics with Python (FBDA)

---

## 📌 Project Overview
This project implements a **Movie Recommendation System** using the **MovieLens 100K dataset** as part of the *Foundations of Big Data Analytics with Python (FBDA)* course.  
The system demonstrates key recommendation techniques including **Collaborative Filtering, Content-Based Filtering, Matrix Factorization**, and **Cosine Similarity**, along with a **Streamlit-based deployment**.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Build an end-to-end recommendation system
- Apply collaborative and content-based filtering techniques
- Use matrix factorization for latent feature learning
- Deploy an interactive recommendation dashboard using Streamlit
- Work with real-world data sourced directly from Kaggle

---

## 🧠 Techniques Used
- **Collaborative Filtering (Item-Based)**
- **Matrix Factorization (SVD)**
- **Cosine Similarity**
- **Text Embedding (TF-IDF)**
- **Streamlit Web Application**
